**Setting up the bot**

Open the [pvp.trade bot](https://t.me/pvptrade_bot) and run `/start` to begin. Next, add it to a group chat with your friends to get started!

**Depositing**

Next, deposit funds to your wallet. You can send either USDC on Hyperliquid, Arbitrum, or Solana. Run `/start` to view the addresses you can send to. You must deposit at least **10 USDC** to begin the bridging process.

**Opening your first position**

Once your account is funded, type /long or /short to open a position. You will then be prompted to choose the ticker, desired leverage, and margin. Next, a popup will indicate your notional position size (Leverage \* Margin) and your liquidation price.  Select confirm to place the market order.

The group chat you created will then be notified of your trade.

**Viewing your positions**

Now that you have an open position, you can view your positions with the `/positions` command, either in DMs with the bot or publically in your group chat.

**You're done!**
