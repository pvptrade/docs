The PVP fee structure consists of **three components**.

## Permanent Level-Based Discounts

Traders unlock permanent fee discounts ending at level 99, with each milestone reducing the base fee progressively. Achieving Level 98 permanently reduces your base fee to low as 0.0350% (3.5bps).

<div class="fees-table-container">
  <table class="fees-table">

    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>


## 30D Volume-Based Discounts

In addition to your level-based discount, trading actively within the last 30 days earns you further fee reductions, up to 1.5 bps. Discounts scale according to your rolling 30-day trading volume:

<div class="volume-table-container">
  <table class="volume-table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Volume</th>
        <th>Discount</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>< \$10,000,000</td><td>0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>≥ \$10,000,000</td><td>-0.003% (0.3 bps)</td></tr>
      <tr><td>≥ \$25,000,000</td><td>-0.006% (0.6 bps)</td></tr>
      <tr><td>≥ \$100,000,000</td><td>-0.009% (0.9 bps)</td></tr>
      <tr><td>≥ \$500,000,000</td><td>-0.012% (1.2 bps)</td></tr>
      <tr><td>≥ \$1,000,000,000</td><td>-0.015% (1.5 bps)</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

## Effective Leverage-Based Discount (Per-Trade)

Every individual trade also qualifies for a dynamic discount determined by its **effective leverage** (post-fill notional value ÷ account equity). The discount grows linearly from **0 bps at 0× leverage** to a maximum of **4 bps at 40× leverage**. Leverage above 40× does not increase the discount.

<div class="leverage-table-container">
  <table class="leverage-table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Effective Leverage</th>
        <th>Additional Discount (bps)</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td>0×</td><td>0</td></tr>
      <tr><td>10×</td><td>1</td></tr>
      <tr><td>20×</td><td>2</td></tr>
      <tr><td>30×</td><td>3</td></tr>
      <tr><td>40× +</td><td>4 (max)</td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

*The leverage discount applies on both the opening and closing side of a position, based on the effective leverage **immediately after** each fill. Total fees can never be negative; any discount that would reduce the fee below 0 bps is capped at 0 bps.*

## Example: Stacking All Discounts

A trader at **Level 98** who also qualifies for the top 30-day volume tier starts with a base fee of **3.5 bps**, reduced by **1.5 bps** for activity to **2 bps**. Entering or exiting a **40×** leveraged position grants the full **4 bps** leverage discount, bringing the effective fee for that trade down to **0 bps** (fee-free). Any lower leverage receives the proportionate discount.

## Spot Fees

Spot fees only apply on sells. Your spot sell fee equals your effective perp fee **multiplied by 5**. Using the example above, the same trader would pay **0.10 %** when selling spot tokens (5 × 0.02 %).
