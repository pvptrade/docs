The PVP points program began on July 27, 2024. Points are distributed each week on Saturdays based on activity and referrals. Users earn 1 point for every 5 points their referred users earn.

There is a total supply of 1,000,000 points. The number of points distributed each week scales with total user activity. As of December 14, 2024, 443,057 points have been distributed.

PVP reserves the right to modify previous point distributions under its sole discretion.
