The PVP points program began on July 27, 2024. Points are distributed each week on Saturdays based on activity and referrals. Users earn 1 point for every 5 points their referred users earn. Only wallets created by PVP (that is, wallets not connected via API) are eligible for points.

There is a total supply of 1,000,000 points. The number of points distributed each week scales with total user activity. As of January 18, 2025, 777,696 points have been distributed.

In addition, bonus points are awarded to the top 10 clans every week. To be eligible for clan bonus points, your clan must have at least 3 active members at the time of snapshot.

PVP reserves the right to modify previous point distributions under its sole discretion.
