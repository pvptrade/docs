## TL;DR

| Tier | Relationship | Your cut |
|------|--------------|---------|
| **L1** | Direct invite | **10 %** |
| **L2** | Invitee of your L1 | **3 %** |
| **L3** | Invitee of your L2 | **1 %** |

## How it works

1. **Share your link.**  
   Anyone who joins with it is an **L1**—you bank **10%** of every fee they pay.

2. **They share theirs.**  
   When an L1 brings in a new user, that newcomer is your **L2**. You collect **3%** on all their fees.

3. **The snowball rolls on.**  
   If an L2 refers someone, that person is your **L3**. You'll earn **1%** on their fees.

That’s it—three simple levels, paid out automatically and forever.
